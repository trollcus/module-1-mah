Demo of Auduno's [face tracking implementation](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr)

The tracker returns x,y positions for a set of well-known facial points. Eg, points 19-22 represent the left eyebrow. Using these coordinates and points, you're able to roughly determine movements of features or orientation of the face itself.
