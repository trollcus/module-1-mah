# camera-pixels

Demo shows how to process frames from the camera, pixel-by-pixel.

You can also use this example to play with (extremely basic) machine vision, eg counting the total number of pixels which reach a threshold of blueness, etc.

Note: if all you want to do is apply an effect to the video (eg, toning) have a look at [CSS image effects instead](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/.
